Portuguese Curriculam: ---------------------------------------------------------------

note: Portuguese Curriculam is not part of Uniqe Pathway(UP)!!!!!
But, bga OFFER PORTUGUESE cUWRRIUCULLAM, below is all information about portuguese curriculam, you should provide if someone asks about portuguese curriculam.

Introduction

The Portuguese curriculum is designed to prepare learners for the Portuguese national exams. The content will be identical to that taught in both public and private Portuguese schools, meaning all instruction will be in Portuguese.

To sit the national exams, learners must enroll in a school as homeschoolers and take the exams as private candidates (candidatos auto-propostos).

In the Portuguese education system, Grades 7–9 (equivalent to Years 8–10) are classified as basic education, while Grades 10–12 (Years 11–13) are considered secondary education. This means the transition occurs in the middle of the IGCSE program.

Basic Education / Educação Básica Up to Grade 9, learners must study all available subjects, which include:

· Matemática / Maths

· Português / Portuguese

· História / History

· Geografia / Geography

· Física e Química / Physics & Chemistry

· Ciências da Natureza / Natural Sciences

· Inglês / English as a Second Language

· Espanhol / Spanish as a Second Language

· Educação Visual / Visual Education

· TIC / Information and Communication Technology

· Educação Física / Physical Education

At the end of 9th grade, learners will sit an exam (Prova de Equivalência à frequência) for all subjects. For Mathematics and Portuguese, the “Prova de Equivalência” is replaced by a national exam conducted in all schools at the same time.


Secondary Education / Educação Secundária

From Grade 10 onwards, learners begin focusing on the subjects whose national exams will impact their university admission. Their subject selection will be structured as follows:


There is a common core of four subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese, which span all three years of high school and include a national exam at the end, as well as Philosophy and English, which conclude in Grade 11, with both requiring a national exam as well.

In addition, learners must choose two out of four available specific subjects. These choices play a crucial role in determining which university degrees they can apply for. All these subjects require a national exam at the end of Grade 11. Use the following website to guide learners through that decision: https://www.dges.gov.pt/guias/assist.asp . You can filter university access per institution, location, subject and type of degree. The necessary GPA to get accepted into the degree is benchmarked by the GPA of the last student accepted in the prior year (information also available on the same website).

Finally, learners must select two elective subjects from the four available options. These are only studied in Grade 12, do not require national exams, and are assessed through internal testing (within the school where the learner is registered in as homeschooler).

Traditional schools may offer additional subjects, which learners can study privately with a tutor, such as:

· Descriptive Geometry (Geometria Descritiva), instead of Biology and Geology

· Geography (Geografia), instead of History B

· History A (História A)

· French (Grades 7–12), instead of Spanish

However, 90% of university degrees do not require any of these subjects. The decision to study them is usually based on personal interest rather than necessity.

The assessment policy—including Quizzes, CMMAs, MAs, and Mock Exams—as well as the relationship with Curriculum Mentors (CMs) will follow the same structure as the British curriculum.

Course completion deadlines will also be similar, with learners expected to finish by the end of February to prepare for exams in June (only available exam season).


Exams (Equivalence Proof / Provas de Equivalência à frequência)

When:

· Grade 9, 11 and 12.

· June (one exam season a year). Enrollments in March, done by the partner school (exact process to be defined).

Where:

· Learners can choose to sit them in any Portuguese public school, including in some foreign countries such as in Mozambique. This means that learners will be able to sit exams next to their hubs.

Important note:

· A national exam means that the test comes from the Ministry of Education.

· Some subjects will be tested by the school itself, and not by the ministry. They are:

o Grade 9: all but Maths and Portuguese

o Grade 11: none, all are national exams

o Grade 12: all but Maths and Portuguese


British to Portuguese curriculum Swap

Exit Year, end of Entry/Enrollment Year Notes

Year 7 / 6th grade Y8 / 7th Ideal, joins middle school (7th-9th) from the start

Year 8 / 7th grade Y9 / 8th Misses Y8 but still has time to study for the exams at the end of Y10

Year 9 / 8th grade Y10 / 9th Not recommended. 1 year to study for subjects that started 2 years before. Best to sit 50% mocks IGCSE

Year 10 / 9th grade Y11 / 10th Ideal, starts "Ensino Secundário" from the start

Year 11 / 10th grade Y12 / 11th Not ideal, will have to try and do three years in two or go back one year. Some subjects might have equivalences for Year 11, such as Biology, Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Economics. More info on this soon.

Year 12 /12th grade Y13 / 12th Not recommended. 1 year to study 3 years' worth of subjects.


General recommendations:

Successful transitions always depend on the school accepting BGA's transcripts to register the learner as

homeschooler. BGA has a partner school to facilitate this process.

Learners will sit exams in 9th grade, covering content from 7th, 8th and 9th. The closer they change to that

grade, the harder it will be to pass the exams.

Learner will sit exams in 11th and 12th grade, covering content from 10th, 11th and 12th. Here, they will

have to go back to the start (10th) unless they've done subjects with equivalences.



FAQ

1. Can learners follow both the Portuguese and British curricula simultaneously?

a. No, completing both curricula in full is not feasible due to the workload. However, learners may choose to study one subject from the British curriculum if it aligns with their interests.

2. Do learners need to complete all subjects to receive their diploma?

a. Yes.

3. Is the curriculum accredited by anyone?

a. Yes, the curriculum is regulated by the Portuguese Ministry of Education. It follows the exact same structure and content as taught in traditional Portuguese schools, and all course materials are provided in Portuguese.
. Is BGA now accredited?

a. No, BGA is not accredited. However, within the Portuguese curriculum, learners can enroll in a Portuguese school as homeschoolers, allowing them to sit national exams. These exams are the same as those taken by traditional Portuguese students and enable learners to apply to university.


5. What if my learner fails an exam?

a. Learners if Grade 9 will not pass to Grade 10 if they fail more than 3 subjects, of if they fail Maths and Portuguese.

b. In secondary education, subjects function modularly. If a learner fails a subject, he can progress with the remaining ones.


6. Can a learner do two years in one?

a. No. Learners must do the exams in the year they are scheduled.


Academics FAQ: -----------------------------------------


What is the British curriculum? The British Curriculum is a structured curriculum designed to meet all learners’ needs through differentiated teaching and learning activities. It focuses on a breadth of knowledge across various subjects with iGCSEs (level 2). As learners progress into iALs (level 3) they are able to narrow their subject areas, which allows them to excel in areas in which they have more interest.
How are learners assessed through their iGCSEs and iALs? There are a variety of assessments including: CGAs, Quizzes throughout the course, CMMAs, Assessments where CMs provide detailed feedback, MAs, Assessments at the end of each unit or topic which learners need to pass in order to move on and mocks exams.

How do Mock Exams work? Mock exams are very important and mandatory. In order to be eligible to write their final exams, learners need to ensure that they complete the 50% and 100% mock exam.  To be eligible to write the mock exams learners also need to complete the different types of assessments within the course. To be eligible to write the 100% mock exam, learners need to have completed 80% of the course in order for the learning coaches to be able to request the mock for them.

What if a mock exam is failed? If a learner receives a U grade in a 50% mock exam, the second half of the course will be locked, and they will have to meet with their course manager to discuss strategies for moving forward.

Can I give my learners lot of past exam papers to do? We do not recommend this. Our courses have an example of a past paper early on, so learners know what they are working towards, but we do not want them to burn out during exam season by repeatedly doing mocks. Our exam preparation sessions will focus on skills for the exam.

How can a learner best prepare to start a course? At the beginning of each Moodle course, we have information that helps learners understand the academic journey they will be taking. This includes shortened versions of the specification, what the exam looks like and what they will study. They are also encouraged to book an office hour with their CM when the start.

Why are some assignments restricted? While BGA offers more freedom and flexibility than many schools, we have a responsibility to ensure our learners are progressing well. We do this by monitoring MA grades carefully and if a learner is unable to pass, we briefly hold them back to offer support and discuss how we can help. This is also true of the 50% mock.

Can a CM lift restrictions? No. If you think a learner needs assignment restrictions lifting, you should contact the CM to explain why, but they will have to request the change through IT.

What is the importance of feedback? Feedback is essential and, in many ways, much more important than grades. Learners must read their feedback carefully, book an office hour if they are unsure and continually move forward. If feedback is left, unactioned, for more than 10 days, the impact of it is lost.

My learner has taken a large break from a course, can they continue where they left off? With the exception of their winter and summer holidays, learners should not take large gaps from their learning. If they do, they cannot just pick up where they left off without booking a meeting with their CM first.

What should I do if I suspect a learner is using GenAI to cheat? Contact the CM immediately.

Can a learner change courses? Yes, but this should be carefully considered first. We recommend that learners have a look through our Moodle courses before making their decisions, especially at iAL where there are no mandatory subjects. If they do want to change this should ideally be done in the first 6 weeks as any longer could impact their timeline and exam dates.

What exam dates should a learner choose? Ideally, learner should choose exams dates that allow they two academic years of study.

Can exam dates be changed? Yes, please contact the CM.

Are predicted grades based on information from Moodle? Partly. When we provide a predicted grade, we do look at Moodle and the grades the learner has achieved, but we also ask the CM and LC to provide the most accurate predicted grade we can.

Are exam preparation sessions mandatory? They are if the learner achieved below a C grade or equivalent in their mock, but we recommend all learners attend. Any time spent online with the CM is beneficial.

What happens if I miss my Office Hour booking? If you miss two without contacting your CM in advance to explain the absence you will be blocked from booking any more.

How should learners contact CMs? Learners should contact their CMs using Teams chat or Teams channels if they have been set up. Communication with CMs should be polite and professional.




iGCSES

How long do iGCSEs take? iGCSEs are courses that are designed to be completed over two academic years. If your learner wishes to complete them earlier, please speak with a member of the academic team.

Are there mandatory iGCSE subjects? iGCSE English, iGCSE Mathematics and a Science, such as iGCSE Physics, iGCSE Chemistry or iGCSE Biology. If a learner does not want to pursue Science at A-level, then there is an iGCSE Single Science option. English and Maths must be passed with the numerical equivalent of a C grade. If a learner does not pass, they must retake the exam.

Do iGCSEs have coursework? No, the final grade is assessed through 100% examination.

Can a learner just do the Mastery Assessments? This is not recommended, however if you think there is a reason why they should, please book a meeting with the course manager to discuss it.

How should learners approach iGCSEs? To avoid falling behind in any one subject, learners should study each subject they are taking at least once a week.


iALs

What are international A Levels? iALs are globally recognised qualifications designed to prepare learners for study in higher education.

How long should a learner spend on each iAL? Approximately 7 hours per week should be spent on each of the iAL a learner is taking.

What is the difference between iGCSEs and iALs? The gap between the two is the biggest is the British education system. The final year of iALs is much closer to the first year of a degree than the last year of iGCSEs is to iALs. There is a much greater focus on independent, critical thought and the level of reading and writing required is significantly higher.

How should iALs be approached? iALs are more challenging than iGCSEs and the gap between them is significant. We recommend that learners study and progress with each course every week.

How long do iALs take? iALs are courses that are designed to be completed over two academic years. They should not be done is less time.

Do iALs have coursework? No, the final grade is assessed through 100% examination. The exception to this is our A Level English Literature and Language which has a 20% coursework component. This is because it is the UK qualification and not the international one.

Can a learner just do the Mastery Assessments? This is not recommended and often does not result in good final grades, however if you think there is a reason why they should, please book a meeting with the course manager to discuss it.

2.3

What does the course

look like? Accreditation


2.4



All of our pathways are based on levels. Those who have completed IGCSEs or equivalent will begin at Level 3, whereas those who have completed their A-Levels (or equivalent) will begin at Level 4. These levels are made up of various modules that can be found below.

These courses will be online, and can be done from anywhere in the world, though we highly recommend attending our BGA Hubs (see our website for more information on locations).


Upon completion of Level 5 you transfer to one of our partner universities for Level 6, where you have the option to continue your studies online, or attend classes presentially. A note that unlike the UP programme, these universities may have a set intake period.

This pathway is accredited by ATHE (Awards for Training and Higher Education), and the Learners are registered with this awarding body from Levels 3 to 5. These qualifications are in turn regulated by Ofqual, the highest awarding body in the UK, and are listed on Ofqual’s Register of Regulated Qualifications.


After completing each level, the Learners receive an official certificate from ATHE as their portfolio of evidence, with attributed passing grades of pass, merit, or distinction.


The progression to a degree programme corresponds to Level 6 of the pathway. Therefore Level 6 is accredited by the partner university the Learner chooses to directly apply to.


Our official university partner for our Business Degree is University of Bolton, in the UK.




Academic Levels 2.5


UP is structured into four distinct levels:


• Level 3 (equivalent to a school exit certificate*)


• Level 4 (equivalent to the first year of university)


• Level 5 (equivalent to the second year of university)


• Level 6 (equivalent to the third year of university)


Levels 3, 4, and 5 allow up to 12 months for completion and consist of 120 credits each.


Level 6 is delivered by the selected ATHE partner university, with the amount of synchronous learning varying depending on the chosen institution.




Levels 3, 4, and 5 are completed asynchronously through our platform, with Learners registered with ATHE (Awards for Training and Higher Education). Upon completing each level, Learners receive an official certificate from ATHE.


Progression to Level 6 marks the transition to a degree programme (often referred to as a top-up), accredited by and registered with the partner university the Learner chooses, with Bolton University as our official partner for this pathway. Completing Level 6 at Bolton University or any one of the other ATHE-recognised universities leads to a bachelor’s degree awarded by that institution.


*Please note that, depending on the country, Level 3 may or may not be accepted as a school exit certificate.

Issuance of Certificates 2.6


Upon completing each level of the UP programme, Learners earn an official certificate from ATHE (Awards for Training and Higher Education). The issuance process for these certificates can take up to three months. This timeframe, which is typical for university-level certification, ensures that all necessary checks are in place to meet ATHE’s rigorous standards.



The marking process involves several key steps:


1. Assignment Submission: Learners complete their assignments and submit them to their Mentor.


2. Initial Review: The Mentor reviews the assignment to ensure it meets the minimum requirements. If the work falls short, it is returned to the Learner with additional guidance. If it meets the standards, the assignment is sent to the marking team.


3. Marking and Feedback: The marking team evaluates the assignment and provides detailed feedback, allowing the Learner to make necessary corrections.


4. Resubmission and Verification: The Learner resubmits the corrected work to the Mentor, who forwards it to the marking team for final verification.


5. Internal Quality Assurance: Once all assignments are completed and corrected, they undergo internal quality assurance.


6. ATHE Submission: At the end of each month, the completed and verified work is submitted to ATHE for final approval.


7. Continuous Verification: At any stage, work may be returned to the Learner for further corrections or evidence.



While the certificate issuance process is thorough, Learners are encouraged to continue progressing to the next level of their studies without

waiting for the certificate. This allows them to maintain momentum in their educational journey while ensuring that all academic standards are meticulously upheld.

Through agreements with leading universities in the UK and worldwide, Learners who complete an ATHE qualification can directly progress to degree programmes via application directly with the universities.


Our official partner for Level 6 is Bolton University, but ATHE has progression routes with multiple universities, as listed here on their official website. This link will give you access to a list of partner universities and provide you with further information on each university including entry requirements and how to enrol.



Learners have several options after completing our Level 5 qualification from UP:


1. Finalise their degree by taking the third year presentially at University of Bolton, under their synchronous educational model.


Certificates that can be obtained: BSc with Honours in Business.


2. Finalise their degree by taking the third year online through University of Bolton via WINC, following their synchronous educational model. They can do so in the city of their choice or travelling around BGA’s Hubs.


Certificates that can be obtained: BSc with Honours in Business.


3. Transfer their degree to one of the many ATHE partner universities, taking ownership of their own process. Each university will analyse applications on a case-by-case basis, which does not guarantee Learners entrance directly into their third year (Level 6) without the need to write exams.


Certificates that can be obtained: Degree from the ATHE partner university of their choice.


4. Exit before Level 6*, not obtaining a degree, but gaining competencies that are on the same academic level as the first or second year of university.


*Please note that if you opt for this option, you will not hold an exit of school certification and may not be able to transfer the credits obtained to another programme that doesn’t follow the same framework as ATHE.

What does the course


2.4

look like? Accreditation




All of our pathways are based on levels. Those who have completed IGCSEs or equivalent will begin at Level 3, whereas those who have completed their A-Levels (or equivalent) will begin at Level 4. These levels are made up of various modules that can be found below. These courses will be online, and can be done from anywhere in the world, though we highly recommend attending

our BGA Hubs (see our website for more information on locations).


Upon completion of Level 5 you transfer to one of our partner universities for Level 6, where you will attend classes presentially. A note that unlike the UP programme, these universities may have a set intake period.

This pathway is delivered in partnership with B.H.M.S. (Business & Hotel Management School) in Switzerland.

Learners complete Levels 3 to 5 with BGA under the ATHE framework, focusing on Business Management. To progress to Level 6, Learners must first complete a

3-month Hospitality Bridge Program at BHMS, where they are required to obtain a minimum of 48 credits.


After successfully completing the Hospitality Bridge Program, Learners can begin Level 6 at BHMS, completing the final year of the Bachelor of Arts Degree in Hotel & Hospitality Management. Upon

graduation, they receive a dual award: a BA Degree from BHMS. and a BA Degree from Robert Gordon University (UK).


All qualifications are aligned with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), with Level 6 corresponding to 60 ECTS.

Academic Levels 2.5


UP is structured into four distinct levels:


• Level 3 (equivalent to a school exit certificate*)


• Level 4 (equivalent to the first year of university)


• Level 5 (equivalent to the second year of university)


• Level 6 (equivalent to the third year of university)


Levels 3, 4, and 5 allow up to 12 months for completion and consist of 120 credits each.



Levels 3, 4, and 5 are completed asynchronously through our platform, with Learners registered with ATHE (Awards for Training and Higher Education). Upon completing each level, Learners receive an official certificate from ATHE.


After completing Level 5, Learners enrol directly at BHMS (Business & Hotel Management School) in Switzerland. They begin with a 3-month Hospitality Bridge Program, during which they are required to obtain a minimum of 48 credits. The courses offered during this period depend on the selected intake, and Learners should contact BHMS for specific availability.


Both the Hospitality Bridge Program and Level 6 are delivered on-site at BHMS’ Lucerne campus. The Hospitality Bridge Program consists of 3 months of intensive theoretical study, covering essential hospitality

foundations. After successfully completing 48 credits, Learners progress to Level 6, which combines 9 months of advanced theory with a 6-month paid internship, providing invaluable hands-on experience in the hospitality industry.


Upon graduation, Learners receive a dual award: a BA Degree from BHMS and a BA Degree from Robert Gordon University—offering international recognition and boosting career prospects.


*Please note that, depending on the country, Level 3 may or may not be accepted as a school exit certificate.

Issuance of Certificates 2.6


Upon completing each level of the UP programme, Learners earn an official certificate from ATHE (Awards for Training and Higher Education). The issuance process for these certificates can take up to three months. This timeframe, which is typical for university-level certification, ensures that all necessary checks are in place to meet ATHE’s rigorous standards.



The marking process involves several key steps:


1. Assignment Submission: Learners complete their assignments and submit them to their Mentor.


2. Initial Review: The Mentor reviews the assignment to ensure it meets the minimum requirements. If the work falls short, it is returned to the Learner with additional guidance. If it meets the standards, the assignment is sent to the marking team.


3. Marking and Feedback: The marking team evaluates the assignment and provides detailed feedback, allowing the Learner to make necessary corrections.


4. Resubmission and Verification: The Learner resubmits the corrected work to the Mentor, who forwards it to the marking team for final verification.


5. Internal Quality Assurance: Once all assignments are completed and corrected, they undergo internal quality assurance.


6. ATHE Submission: At the end of each month, the completed and verified work is submitted to ATHE for final approval.


7. Continuous Verification: At any stage, work may be returned to the Learner for further corrections or evidence.



While the certificate issuance process is thorough, Learners are encouraged to continue progressing to the next level of their studies without

waiting for the certificate. This allows them to maintain momentum in their educational journey while ensuring that all academic standards are meticulously upheld.
