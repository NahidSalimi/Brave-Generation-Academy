Brave Bot (BB) - Admissions
Topic 1: Transfer of Programmes (Remote/UP/BAS)


Q1: My Learner wishes to transfer from Hybrid (the Hub) to BGA Remote (full online) permanently (due to changes in location, or just a preference). What do I need to do?

A1: If the Learner wishes to permanently transfer from Hybrid to BGA Remote, the first step is assuring that they and their family accept the changes in the approach of the Remote model, and have the expectations aligned. The second step is to write an email, with the family in CC, informing Admissions of their choice. Click here to view the steps in detail, including the list of topics that you have to approach in step 1.



Q2: My Learner is travelling for some period of time (up to 3 months) and will stop attending the Hub. Do they need to transfer to BGA Remote?

A2: No, we only transfer Learners from Hybrid to BGA Remote if they are going full online permanently. Therefore, you should evaluate how you can provide them with online support while they are absent from the Hub. They will remain Active on your Learners List, with a reserved spot at your Hub.



Q3: My Learner wishes to possibly join the UP Programme. How should I proceed?

A3: Please coordinate a meeting with Esther, Head of our UP Programme, so she can explain the programme to the Learner and check their eligibility. Esther will communicate directly with Admissions, and Admissions will inform the LCs if the transfer officialises and what they will have to do as the final step. Check the steps in detail here.



Q4: My Learner wishes to possibly join the BAS (Brave Academy of Sports) programme. What’s next?

A4: All you need to do is coordinate a meeting with the BAS team, Rodrigo, Nico and Conrad, so they can explain the programme to the Learner and check their eligibility. The BAS team will communicate directly with Admissions, and Admissions will inform the LCs if the transfer officialises. Check all the steps here.



Topic 2: Transfer of Curriculum (UK/US/UP/Portuguese)



Q1: My Learner wishes to transfer from the British Curriculum to the US Curriculum. What do I need to do?

A1: The most updated procedure is the following:

Inform the Admissions team via email, so they can send detailed information, including pricing, and next steps to the parents.

The Learning Coaches (LCs) will prepare the report (check the step-by-step here) and send it to Admissions and Danielle Roodt.

Danielle will confirm the academic level of the Learner.

Learner will choose the subject that they wish to study at FIA.

LCs will send to Admissions and Danielle the subject selection.

Admissions will send a final confirmation to FIA, the LCs and the family.

FIA will send the Learner’s credentials to you and the family.



Please check the SharePoint for further details: Team Site Notebook



Q2: My Learner wishes to possibly join the UP Programme. How should I proceed?

A2: Please coordinate a meeting with Esther, Head of our UP Programme, so she can explain the programme to the Learner and check their eligibility. Esther will communicate directly with Admissions, and Admissions will inform the LCs if the transfer officialises and what they will have to do as the final step. Check the steps in detail here.



Q3: My Learner wishes to transfer to the Portuguese+ Curriculum. What do I need to do?

A3: Please inform the Admissions team via email, so they can send detailed information, including pricing, and next steps to the parents. Once the enrolment process is completed, Admissions will send you a confirmation email.



Q4: When will my Learner receive their new curriculum credentials?

A4: After Admissions sends the LCs the confirmation emails regarding the conclusion of the transfer process, the credentials will be shared with the LCs and Learners according to the following:

If the Learner is switching to a curriculum we outsource (US or UP), the providers will send you and the Learner the credentials after the process is finalised. In the case of UP, the mentors will send you the credentials right after your onboarding session takes place.

If the Learner switches to the UK or Portuguese+ curricula, Amanda (IT) will be the point of contact for the platform courses after the process is finalised.



Topic 3: Transfer of Hubs



Q1: My learner wants to be transferred to another hub. What do I need to do?

LCs must decide among themselves: the team of the Hub of origin must contact the team of the Hub the Learner wishes to transfer to, requesting the transfer approval. CC your DCs when needed;

LCs must refer to their DCs whenever is a sensitive case/concern that they need further advice on;

LCs inform Admissions via the Teams Channel so Admissions can make the alterations to our documents;

New LC will add parents to the WhatsApp group and send the parents the Hub Booklet;

Notify our US Curriculum provider in case they are doing the American Curriculum.

>>> Please note that changes in Moodle must be requested directly to Amanda (IT) after all is confirmed.



Topic 4: Official Learners List



Q1: Why can’t I find my Learners on the Official Learners List?

A1: Please check if you have any filters applied to one of the columns. If you do, make sure to clear the filter. Always select all the options in the Status column (Active, Inactive, In Progress, In Progress-ok, Waiting List, Waiting List - ok) as the status of the Learner you’re looking for may have changed.

Additionally, ensure you have clicked on Trust Worktools warning so the document is synchronised. For a step-by-step explanation with illustrations of how to do this, please refer to our SharePoint: Team Site Notebook



Q2: What does the 'Progress', 'In-Progress' ,’Active’, and ‘Inactive’ means in the Official Learners List.

A2:

In the first column Status, the Learners are labeled according to the following:

Active (learners that are currently attending the hub)

Inactive (learners that have withdrawn from BGA)

In progress (learners that will have their onboarding meeting yet)

In progress – ok (learners that have been through the onboarding meeting but haven't started attending the hub yet)

Waitlist – ok (to identify learners that are Active in another Hub view, but in the Waiting List of another Hub. Therefore, this learner is Active in a Hub view, since they are attending BGA, but as Waitlist - ok in another Hub view to inform us that they wish to move there eventually)

Waitlist (to identify learners that are in the Waiting List of a Hub, and not Active in any other Hub. Therefore, they are just waiting for a vacancy to open in that specific Hub to start in BGA)

Graduated (learners that graduated)



Q3: My Learner has the incorrect academic level on the Official Learners List. How do I update it?

A3: Please send a message on our Admissions Teams channel with the most updated information so we can update our database. The same is valid for any type incorrections in the Official Learners List.



Topic 5: Unannounced Parental Hub Visits



Q1: A parent arrived at the Hub unexpectedly to learn more about BGA. How should I proceed?

A1: Upon an unannounced visit from a parent to the Hub, provide them with an introduction about BGA while showing our Hub to them. It is essential to ensure that the parent feels welcomed and valued throughout the interaction.

Please proceed by gathering the parent's essential contact details, including their name, phone number, email address, as well as their child's name and age. Please also exchange with them our contact details: Email (contact@bravegenerationacademy.com) and Phone Number/WhatsApp: (+351 913 578 362).

Once this information is collected, kindly send it to the Admissions Team via the Teams channel of your Hub, ensuring all relevant details and any inquiries raised during the visit are included. The Admissions Team will then initiate contact with the family, providing them with information about us and guiding them through our admissions process.



Q2: If I need it on the spot, what is the guest user login for showing the platform?

A2: The guest access to show our UK Curriculum platform is the following:

Q2: How does the scheduling of hub visits or trials work for BGA Remote?

A2: We will get in touch with the LC at their corresponding BGA Remote Channel.

In the message, we will ask them for their availability to have an online meeting with the prospect to show them the BGA platform and Remote online environment.

In the future, we will launch FREEMIUM, which will grant families interested in the Remote option access to our platform for one week. Once we launch this promotion, we will use it instead of our current procedure.



Topic 5: Onboarding Day and Credentials



Q1: Where can I find my Learner’s login details when they arrive at the Hub for the first day?

The Learner login details are always sent via email (subject line: “Onboarding Day – Learner's Name” ) to the Learner, with the LCs in CC, prior to their first day. Admissions only send their credentials once they have completed the admissions process (paid and signed contracts).

The exception is if the Learner is doing a curriculum we outsource (US or UP). In this case, the providers will send you and the Learner the credentials after the process is finalised on their end. In the case of UP, the mentors will send you the credentials right after your onboarding session takes place.



Q2: A Learner has arrived at my Hub, but they don’t have their login details yet. What should I do?

A2: If you can’t seem to find your Learner’s credentials, the first step is to confirm receiving the details by double-checking your email and the Status of the Learner on your Official Admissions List: if you didn’t receive the email and the Status of this Learner is not as Active, the reason for they not receiving their credentials is that they didn’t complete their admissions process yet.

The second step is to please inform the family that you’re going to check with Admissions, while making them comfortable at the Hub. Please proceed to reach out to us via Teams or through a call via Teams or via our phone number (+351 913 578 362). We will check what the family needs to complete in order to have their admissions process finalised and send them a follow up email.

The third step is that you’re going to please inform that they need to finalise their admissions process and that the Admissions team will follow up via email with the missing documents. The Learner will be able to start attending the Hub as soon as they complete the process and agree on a first day of classes with Admissions.



Topic 8: Declarations & Academic Reports



Q1: How do I request for Declaration of Enrolment or a Declaration of for public transportation discounts?

A1: You can request it via our Admissions Teams channel.



Q2: How do I request my Learner’s Academic Report/Certificate?

A2. Certificates of conclusion/academic certificates are prepared by the Academics team, except for Learners who are doing the US Curriculum – in this case, they are prepared by the external provider team.

For Learners doing our UK or Portuguese curricula, please request the certificate via the following link: Microsoft Forms. Kindly note this link is to be used only by LC's; please do not share it.

In the case of external providers, please contact the provider’s point of contact and request the academic certificate. To learn more, please refer to our SharePoint.



Topic 9: Withdrawals & Graduation Processes



Q1: How do I proceed if my Learner is going to withdrawal from BGA?

A1: Please send an email with the link to the withdrawal form (which contains the relevant information about the process and transfer of schools) to the Learner's family with Admissions in CC. Access the template of email to be sent to the families in our SharePoint.



Q2: How do I proceed if my Learner was asked to leave BGA (expelled)?

A2: Please inform the Admissions team via email that the Learner is leaving, by when, and that the Learner was asked to leave BGA by the team.



Q3: How do I remove any Learners from the WorkTools after they are no longer at BGA?

A3: First, please if they are no longer at BGA by checking that they show up at the Official Learners List with a Status as Inactive or Graduated. Once you confirm that they have any of these statuses, please refer to Luis Brito with your request to have them removed from the WorkTools.



Q4: When should I inform Admissions that my Learner is graduating from BGA?

A4: LCs must complete the Graduation Form with the Learner. Ideally Admissions would receive the form submission two months prior to the Learner’s graduation date. That way, we can make sure to proceed with all administrative changes. Click here to access the form link and further details.



Topic 10: Academic Level Progression - Updates & Questions



Q1: My learner is doing UP and they passed to the next level. How should I proceed?

A1: Please write an email to Admissions with the family in CC informing us of this level progression. Admissions will then reply to the email with the next steps that the family needs to take before we can enrol the Learner in the next Level.



Q2: My Learner has the incorrect academic level on the Official Learners List. How do I update it?

A2: Please send a message on our Admissions Teams channel with the most updated information so we can update our database. The same is valid for any type incorrections in the Official Learners List.



Topic 11: Hub Capacity and Availability



Q1: How can I check how many available spots we have at our Hub?

A1: On the 'Hubs' tab of the Official Learners List, you will find a list of all our Hubs, their capacities, and the number of Learners each Hub currently has (including those who have not yet started but are in the process of completing admissions).



Q2: The hub capacity listed on the Official Learners List exceeds what we can accommodate. Who should I contact to review and adjust the Hub capacity?

A2: The responsible for deciding or changing the hub capacity is the Operations Department. Please reach out to Paulo Dinis about this matter and give Admissions an update via our Teams channel once you have confirmation.



Topic 12: Others



Q1: Couldn’t find a topic that replies to your question?

A1: Please send us your question(s) via our Admissions Teams channel so we can reply to it and add it to our F&Q. Thank you.














General Overview

Please check the following detailed flow chart of our Admissions and Onboarding Procedures: https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/YTJJVzA5ZmliWUxwSjhVWjRaejU0NTEzZEV0OU1LTlR0WjRzNFNlWHA5ZmlaWWdoVUNMMjlod0xYR1ZIQ0laenwzNDU4NzY0NTE1MzMyNDk5Mzk5fDI=?share_link_id=436342912496



>>> Initial Contact can happen directly with the LCs, but families are to be directed to the Admissions Team:

LCs should get their phone and email addresses, and share them with us via our Admissions channel at the Hub Team, so we can reach out to them.

LCs should also share our contact information with them: email (contact@bravegenerationacademy.com) and phone (+351 913 578 362).



First Contact:



Introducing BGA through meetings or weekly webinars; answering queries and process guidance.

Communication with the families can be via email, phone, or WhatsApp.





Application Phase:



Mandatory Hub visits or trial days; coordination of those with Hub LCs via Teams.

Hub visit or trial day details (including guest user to platform) are sent via a calendar invite to LCs and families, after LCs confirmation via Teams.

Any special needs case will have to undergo evaluation from the LCs during the Trial Day. LCs will let Admissions know if we can move forward.

Families receive the Application Form link.



Onboarding Meeting:



After submitting the Application Form, the families are invited to book an Onboarding Meeting after they have passed their English Test.

The presence of Learning Coaches (LCs) is mandatory.

Onboarding meetings are scheduled by the Admissions Team.

Confirmation of Academic Level placement; the start date is not to be confirmed during this meeting.



Post-Onboarding:



Admissions Team follows up.

Learners can attend BGA after sending i) signed contract, ii) proof of payment, and (if needed) iii) last term report.



First Day Preparations*:



Admissions sends first-day instructions and platform access details.





*For the American Curriculum and UP, there's a last step involved in the process: we send a separate email to the LCs with a link for them to book a meeting with the eCampus Academy/GenEx and the learner, so all of you can get onboarded into their platform. After the LCs book this meeting, they should confirm with Admissions so we keep the dates in the first day instructions aligned.







The Official Learners List is an Excel document that serves the purpose of providing the Central and LC teams with a database of all BGA Learners.



1.Instructions on how to use the document:




Step 1) Open the document: Official Learners List

Step 1.1) Go to View

Step 1.2) Select the hub in the drop-down menu you wish to visualize:
2.Understanding the document:



In the first column Status, the Learners are labeled according to the following:

Active (learners that are currently attending the hub)

Inactive (learners that have withdrawn from BGA)

In progress (learners that will have their onboarding meeting yet)

In progress – ok (learners that have been through the onboarding meeting but haven't started attending the hub yet)

Waitlist – ok (to identify learners that are Active in another Hub view, but in the Waiting List of another Hub. Therefore, this learner is Active in a Hub view, since they are attending BGA, but as Waitlist - ok in another Hub view to inform us that they wish to move there eventually)

Waitlist (to identify learners that are in the Waiting List of a Hub, and not Active in any other Hub. Therefore, they are just waiting for a vacancy to open in that specific Hub to start in BGA)

Graduated (learners that graduated)





2.How we use the filters to save the Hub Views:



We saved the hub views by i) clicking on the filter option in the column Hub and selecting the corresponding Hubs, and ii) Status and filtering by only the labels Active, In progress, In progress - ok, so the view becomes more relevant for you.


If you wish to play around with the filters to extract certain relevant data for you, please do so on the Default View by selecting the option See just mine, so you don't edit the
saved views of the Hubs.





3.What to do if my Learners are not showing up in my Hub View:



This is probably happening because someone altered the filters directly to the Hub View, instead of using the Default View. It's an easy fix. Just look for the filters that are activated and change them back according to the section 2 above.



To quickly spot the filters that are activated by accident, please refer to the symbol circled in the below image.

As you can see, the filter in the column Grade is activated, and therefore all Grades must be selected in order to show all Learners from that respective Hub.

>>> Important notes to consider:



Please open this document in the desktop view only, not via the Excel app



Nobody but Admissions can edit the document, therefore, any changes that need to be made are to be communicated to the Admissions team via the Teams Channel. The Admissions team has its own document, they will alter the information on that document, which will then feed the Official Learners List. It's important that LCs confirm having all the learners in their respective hubs



The second sheet contains an overview of all hubs, including their capacity



When opening the document, always click on the "Trust Workbook Links" warning so it synchronises

 Hub Visits/Trials

 Automated Procedure:


1. Admissions shares a hub calendar link with families interested so they can book it according to their preferred dates and times.

2. Once booked, the visit or trial confirmation notification will arrive at the Hub's shared mailbox (contact Amanda if you can't visualise your shared mailbox).

3.Admissions will add the LCs emails to the calendar events so LCs can have the events saved to the their calendars as well and access to the family info (their info will be in the event description and notes).

*The slots are blocked according to the following Standard Hub Availability doc.




Reminder: always inform admissions in advance if any standard availability changes or the Hubs need to close for some reason.

--
Procedure for when there is a special request due to mismatch between parents and hubs standard availabilities:


1. Whenever a prospective clients requests Admissions to coordinate a Hub visit or trial day, Admissions asks for their preferred dates;



2. Admissions asks, via our Channel in Teams, for the LCs' confirmation that the visit can happen on the specific date given;



3. After Admissions get the LCs' confirmation, the Hub visit or trial day details (including guest user to platform) are sent via a calendar invite to LCs and families.



--

>>> Admissions will always schedule the visits. However, prospects can find the Hub addresses online and show up unannounced. Please be mindful and recall the 3-step code of conduct in cases like this:



Welcome the families: this will be their first impression of the Hub and our Team;

Present the Hub environment and connect their children to a Learner;

Get the family contact information: name, email address, and phone number.



If you cannot have the visit at the moment, after the 3rd step, tell them that the BGA Admissions Team will get in touch to book a date so they can get to know your Hub in detail.



Always share, in any case, the families' information with the Admissions team via our Channel in Teams, so we can get in contact with them.


--

>>> The Hub Trial days are mandatory (whenever the family is already applying from a location where we have a hub), especially in cases of Special Needs. When those cases are brought to our attention by the family, Admissions will request additional documentation and direct them for a Trial Day. The Special Needs case will then be evaluated by the LCs during the trial day, and the LCs may confirm with Admissions if we can move forward with their enrolment or not (LCs are required to send Admissions and Danielle a feedback email after the Hub Visit/Trial Day).

--

*Online Hub Visits:

Admissions will go through the same scheduling process as above, and will send the families and LCs a calendar invite for the virtual "visit";

The LCs will join the event via Teams;

LCs will introduce themselves to the interested family, show the platform and a the hub, talk about what a day in their hub is like.



*We are launching "Freemium", through which the interested families will be able to have a special login to our platform. They will be able to navigate through it and test it out as in a trial day. This option will be available for families interested in the BGA Online programme, or families that cannot visit the hub in-person at the moment and want to test out the platform (didn't relocate to a location where we do have a hub yet).

We look forward to the onboarding meeting scheduled for August 28th.

Kind regards,
Anna"




=> Credit Transfer:

Bob will ensure that the learner receives the appropriate credits for their completed coursework.





UK to US Process Flow Chart:


US to UK Curriculum:



1. LCs must write an email to Admissions with family in CC so Admissions can guide them through the change;



2. Once the family concludes the administrative steps involved in the change, Admissions informs the LCs via email about the next steps: LCs may book a meeting between them and the Learner to introduce to them the BGA platform.





UK/US to UP Programme:



LCs should coordinate a meeting with the Head of the UP Programme, Esther Silva, so she can explain it and check their eligibility;



Esther must write a communication to Admissions so Admissions can guide them through the change;



Once the family concludes the administrative steps involved in the change, Admissions informs the LCs via email about the next step: LCs may book a meeting between them, the Learner and their new programme tutor using the information that Admissions sent via email.







UK/US/UP to BGA Remote Programme:



Step 1. DCs/LCs, when they are informed by the learner or their family that they want to switch to Remote, should call in a meeting with the learner and family to set clear expectations regarding the transfer;



Step 2. The DCs/LCs will then write an email to the family, with Admissions in CC, explaining that Admissions will send the necessary next steps for the transfer to happen;



Step 3. Admissions will then send the family this email template that will contain a recap of the important expectations:

Template:

"Prior to signing the quote and proceeding with the payment, we would like to recap important information to ensure the understanding of the commitment and expectations associated with the BGA Remote programme.



Expectations for the Transition to BGA Remote Programme



It is important to set clear expectations considering the transfer of your child from the BGA Hybrid programme to BGA Remote. While BGA Remote provides online support and educational resources, it differs from the Hybrid programme in several key areas, requiring greater parental involvement and commitment.



Below are important points to consider:



Parental Involvement and Learning Environment: The BGA Remote programme requires more active participation and oversight from parents. This model is closer to a homeschooling approach and, while our team will provide substantial support, parents are expected to ensure that the Learner is in an appropriate study environment, particularly during assessments or exam-like conditions. Creating a conducive learning space free from interruptions is essential to the Learner’s success.



Learner Accountability: In the BGA Remote programme, Learners are responsible for their own engagement and participation. If a Learner fails to respond or participate in their lessons, the responsibility falls on them to reconnect with their learning journey. This model requires a high degree of discipline and self-motivation. It is common for Learners to face periods of demotivation, so establishing a structured routine and receiving continuous parental support are critical for their adaptation and sustained motivation.



Accreditation and Legal Compliance: Parents must understand that, with the BGA Remote programme being 100% online, it is the family’s full responsibility to ensure compliance with local laws and accreditation requirements. Parents need to inform themselves about local educational regulations and evaluate if they need to take necessary actions to maintain legal compliance. BGA can assist by offering directly to the family supporting documentation on the Learner’s academic progress and engagement. This includes regular reports and guidance from Learning Coaches, similar to what is offered in the Hybrid programme.



Exam Registration: In the BGA Remote model, it is the parents’ responsibility to find and register their child at an appropriate exam centre as a private candidate. While BGA will continue to assist and provide guidance to help identify potential exam centres, this responsibility will no longer be managed by BGA."

--



Step 4. Parents sign our Quote, which contains the BGA Remote Terms and Conditions and proceed with the payment.



Step 5. Admissions inform new Remote LC that the process is finalised.





UK/US/UP to Brave Academy of Sports (BAS):



LCs should coordinate a meeting with the Head of the BAS Programme, Rodrigo Pereira, so he can explain it and check their eligibility;



Rodrigo must write a communication to Admissions so Admissions can guide them through the change;



Once the family concludes the administrative steps involved in the change, Admissions informs the LCs via email about the next step: LCs may book a meeting between them, the Learner and their new sport coaches using the information that Admissions sent via email.





---------------

Why it is necessary to involve Admissions: whenever families change to another programme or curriculum, their fees may vary or we may require additional documentation on their part. Therefore:

Admissions needs to make sure the family is aware and accepts the terms changes.

Admissions needs to identify the changes across our platforms and systems.

Admissions needs any additional invoice to be paid before proceeding with the next steps.


-----------------
Notes:



>>> Admissions will always CC the LCs in the communications with the parents regarding this process so everyone is on the same page.



>>> Changes in programmes: for instance, a BGA learner wants to switch from British Curriculum to UP. This change has to be authorised by a member of the educational team (Esther Silva), so always refer to them first, then communicate to Admissions.



>>> Please note that changes in Moodle must be requested directly to Amanda (IT) after all is confirmed.

 UK to US Curriculum (FIA)

 (UPDATED FIA PROCEDURE follows below and applies to any new Learners that manifest their interest in the US curriculum from the 28th of January 2025.

Step 4. Parents sign our Quote, which contains the BGA Remote Terms and Conditions and proceed with the payment.





Step 5. Admissions will send an internal email informing both previous and new Remote LCs that the process is finalised so they can book their first meeting with the Learner and initiate the handover process.



Step 6. Initiate handover process between LCs: Previous LCs should reply to the email from Admissions, with the new Remote LCs in CC, with the following proposed template:



"Dear [New Remote LC],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide a handover for [Learner’s Full Name], who is transferring to BGA Remote and will now be under your guidance. Below is a summary of their progress and relevant details to ensure a smooth transition:



Learner Overview:

All internal tools have been updated with relevant notes, and I am available should you need any further clarification. If there are any outstanding issues or necessary follow-ups, please do not hesitate to reach out.



Best regards,"

--



Step 7. New Remote LCs will book their first meeting with the Learner.

 UK/US/UP to BAS (Brave Academy of Sports)

 LCs should coordinate a meeting with the BAS Programme team, Rodrigo Pereira, Nico and Conrad, so they can explain it and check their eligibility;



Rodrigo, or other BAS team member, must write a communication to Admissions so Admissions can guide them through the change;



Once the family concludes the administrative steps involved in the change, Admissions informs the BAS team and LCs via email.

 Additional Notes

 Why it is necessary to involve Admissions: whenever families change to another programme or curriculum, their fees may vary or we may require additional documentation on their part. Therefore:

Admissions needs to make sure the family is aware and accepts the terms changes.

Admissions needs to identify the changes across our platforms and systems.

Admissions needs any additional invoice to be paid before proceeding with the next steps.


-----------------
Notes:



>>> Admissions will always CC the LCs in the communications with the parents regarding this process so everyone is on the same page.



>>> Changes in programmes: for instance, a BGA learner wants to switch from British Curriculum to UP. This change has to be authorised by a member of the educational team (Esther Silva), so always refer to them first, then communicate to Admissions.



>>> Please note that changes in Moodle must be requested directly to Amanda (IT) after all is confirmed.

 UP Academic Level Progression

 Academic Level Progression - Updates & Questions



Question 1: My learner is doing UP and they passed to the next level. How should I proceed?

Answer 1: Please write an email to Admissions with the family in CC informing us of this level progression. Admissions will then reply to the email with the next steps that the family needs to take before we can enrol the Learner in the next Level.

Hub Transfers

LCs must decide among themselves: the team of the Hub of origin must contact the team of the Hub the Learner wishes to transfer to, requesting the transfer approval. CC your DCs when needed;



LCs must refer to their DCs whenever is a sensitive case/concern that they need further advice on;



LCs inform Admissions via the Teams Channel so Admissions can make the alterations to our documents;



New LC will add parents to the WhatsApp group and send the parents the Hub Booklet;



New LCs notify external provider in case they are doing the American Curriculum (eCampus or FIA team)*



*New LCs receive information from previous LCs about their learners. During this handover process, if a learner is enrolled at the American curriculum, the new LCs are requested to notify and introduce themselves to the partner accordingly (either eCampus or FIA; the LCs can check confirm this information on the learners list).



>>> Please note that changes in Moodle must be requested directly to Amanda (IT) after all is confirmed.



Handover process:


Step 1. Initiate handover process between LCs: Previous LCs should email the new LCs, with the following proposed template:



"Dear [New LC],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide a handover for [Learner’s Full Name], who is transferring to [new Hub name] and will now be under your guidance. Below is a summary of their progress and relevant details to ensure a smooth transition:



Learner Overview:

Sprint Report: [Attach Last Sprint Report]

Strengths: [Brief summary of academic and personal strengths]

Areas for Improvement/Concerns: [Attendance, engagement, challenges, special educational needs, etc.]

All internal tools have been updated with relevant notes, and I am available should you need any further clarification. If there are any outstanding issues or necessary follow-ups, please do not hesitate to reach out.



Best regards,"

--



Step 2. New LCs will book their first meeting with the Learner.
Scholarship Revocation
We have two formal scholarship reassessment moments, December and June, when each learner’s performance is reviewed based on the following KPIs:

Number of unjustified absences

Hub attendance

Participation in exam preparation sessions

Platform progress

Other relevant factors (Skills, Community and Behaviour)


However, it’s essential that RMs and LCs monitor and document red flags throughout the year, not just at those checkpoints.


What to do:

When a learner is not fulfilling their responsibilities, LCs inform parents via email or in meeting minutes. This is crucial to ensure that, should a scholarship be revoked, it doesn't come as a surprise.

Once a decision is made, Admissions will send the formal scholarship revocation email, including a clear summary of all the documented concerns and unmet expectations (shared by the LCs and RMs).
Withdrawal & Graduation
) BGA Learner that decides to leave:

LCs get informed by the Learner/Learner's family that they wish to leave BGA;



LCs send an email with the link to the withdrawal form (which contains the relevant information about the process and transfer of schools) to the Learner's family with Admissions in CC;

--

Suggested Template that can be used:



Dear Parent Names,



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on your enrolment termination notice.


We're very sad to hear that you're withdrawing your child from BGA. However, we understand if you feel that's the best decision to make at this point.

Please fill in the following form to start the withdrawal process: form link
This form will serve as an official notice of your termination and will be considered for the administrative and financial withdrawal processes.


We wish you and your family all the best.

Thank you.

--

 Admissions will proceed with the changes in the shared documents and platform according to the information in the form provided by the family;



LCs must please remove the families that have withdrawn from the WhatsApp groups.





b) BGA Learner who was asked to leave by the BGA team:

The LCs must inform the Admissions team via email that the Learner is leaving, by when, and that the Learner was asked to leave BGA by the team;



Admissions will send an email to the family formalising the withdrawal;



Admissions will proceed with the changes in the shared documents and platform accordingly;

 2. Graduation: Graduation Form and Alumni Directory



Once a Learner has passed their final mock exam and is approved to sit their finals (or has a projected final academic date if they’re in the American curriculum or UP), please send them the graduation email.

You’re welcome to personalise the message, but please do not alter the main content.

Fill in the brackets with the appropriate information and CC contact@bravegenerationacademy.com. This step is essential for admissions to mark the Learner as graduating and to stop payments when the time comes.

Admissions will proceed with the changes in the shared documents and platform according to the information in the form provided;

LCs must remove the families that have graduated from the WhatsApp groups.


The Alumni Form included in the email is crucial. It allows us to:

Keep in touch with our graduates.

Gather valuable feedback on the BGA experience.

Build a knowledge-sharing network for current and future Learners.

Please follow up with your graduating Learners to ensure they complete the form. Thank you for your support in making this process both smooth and meaningful for our growing community.

The alumni form, the graduation email, and the spreadsheet with the alumni information will also be available on the marketing sharepoint.



>>> The Admissions team will let the LCs know in the instances we are the ones to first get informed that a Learner is leaving BGA.

Unengaged Learners: Enrolment Cancellation Procedure
Admissions will initiate the enrolment cancellation policy for learners that are non-responsive to the LCs and RMs contact attempts:


1. Call + Send the first email asking for an update within a week, as our LC has been trying to contact the family for 2 weeks.

2. Call + Send the second email advising that we will have to proceed with the cancellation of enrolment if they don't contact us within a week.

3. Send the third email informing that the learner's enrolment has effectively been cancelled due to lack of involvement.



We request that that you inform us if the family makes direct contact with you (LCs or RMs).
Declaration Requests
DECLARATIONS OF ENROLMENT & TRANSPORTATION DISCOUNT:



1. LCs must request them to Admissions via our Teams Channel.





BGA CERTIFICATES OF CONCLUSION/TRANSCRIPT

Certificates of conclusion are prepared by the Academics team, except for learners that are doing the US Curriculum – in this case, they are prepared by the external provider team.



(eCampus Only): US CURRICULUM at eCampus GRADUATION CERTIFICATE REQUEST:

Below is some clarification regarding the graduation on the American curriculum:

After a student completes the required coursework, teachers have approximately one week beyond the end of the calendar year to complete grades and enter them into our student management system.

Watertown (the US School) issues a diploma and an official transcript indicating that the learner has met the school’s graduation requirements

The diploma is shipped  directly to the BGA hub where the learner has been enrolled unless the family provides them with a home address to which they’d like it sent. As for transcripts, they can mail and/or email them to both families and, upon request of a college, will forward them to the institution.

**Transcripts may be requested at this link https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/51931745/institution **



BGA does not issue a certificate in this case, only eCampus.
